# 🐍 Python Mini Calculator

A simple, command-line interface calculator built with Python that performs basic arithmetic operations, modulus, and average calculation. This was an assignment task for this python bootcamp.

## ✨ Features

* **Addition** (`+`)
* **Subtraction** (`-`)
* **Multiplication** (`*`)
* **Division** (`/`) - Includes **zero-division handling**!
* **Modulus** (`%`)
* **Average** of two numbers
* **Maximum** of two numbers
* Continuous operation loop until the user chooses to exit.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You only need **Python 3.x** installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (assuming you name your file `calculator.py`):
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/fahim-nion/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/fahim-nion/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
2.  **Run the script** from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

When you run the script, you'll be greeted with a menu:

.  **Enter the number** corresponding to the operation you want to perform (e.g., `1` for Add).
2.  **Enter your two numbers** when prompted.
3.  The result will be displayed, rounded to two decimal places.
4.  You will be asked if you want to **continue** (`yes/no`).
5.  Choose `8` to **Exit** the program at any time.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is a single-file application (`calculator.py` - assuming the file name) containing all the logic.

### Functions

The calculator utilizes several well-defined functions:

| Function Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `addition(a, b)` | Returns the sum of $a$ and $b$. |
| `subtraction(a, b)` | Returns the difference between $a$ and $b$. |
| `multiplication(a, b)` | Returns the product of $a$ and $b$. |
| `division(a, b)` | Returns the quotient of $a$ and $b$. |
| `modulus(a, b)` | Returns the remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$. |
| `avg(a, b)` | Returns the average of $a$ and $b$. |
